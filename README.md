# image_scraper

A tiny image scraper built to bulk-download a list of wanted images while experimenting with multiprocessing.

Built to bulk download the [Original Stitch Pok√©mon patterns](https://originalstitch.com/pokemon). Some considerations were taken regarding content types, as the image URLs don't match the actual content type received (ex. 444.jpg returns a .png).

Simply run the main script in the root directory.
